What Happens When You Type https://www.google.com and Press Enter? (With a Pretty Diagram!)

You Type the Web Address:
Imagine you're sitting at your computer, excited to search for something on Google. You type "https://www.google.com" and hit Enter.

DNS Resolution:
Your computer, let's call it "Your PC," sends a message to a magical address book called DNS. This book, operated by your internet service provider, reveals where Google lives in the vast world of the internet.

Hitting Google's Door:
Equipped with Google's address (IP), Your PC knocks on Google's door using a special internet handshake called TCP/IP. It's like saying, "Hey Google, I'm coming over!"

Traffic Encryption:
To keep your conversation private, Your PC and Google start talking in a secret code using HTTPS. It's the internet's way of whispering so that no one else can eavesdrop.

Firewall Security:
Before entering Google's house, your conversation passes through a firewall. Picture it as a vigilant security guard checking your credentials to ensure you're a friendly visitor.

Load-Balancing Magic:
Google has many doors (servers). A friendly traffic director called the load balancer ensures that all visitors (requests) are evenly distributed, preventing any server from feeling overwhelmed.

Web Server Welcome:
Your request lands at one of Google's web servers. These servers are like welcoming hosts ready to assist with whatever you're searching for.

Application Server Creativity:
If your request needs a bit of creativity, an application server steps in. Imagine it as an artist creating a personalized masterpiece - your search results.

Database Data Hunt:
For intricate requests, the application server may need additional information from a database. It embarks on a quick quest, fetching the required data.

Serving the Web Page:
The web server, application server, and database collaborate to build a beautiful webpage, tailored just for you.
