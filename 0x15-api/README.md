What is an API?

An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules and tools that allows different 
software applications to communicate with each other. 
It serves as a bridge, enabling seamless interaction between different components. 
APIs are commonly used in web development to facilitate communication between clients (e.g., web browsers) and servers.
